Utitily function of Max pooling image in tensorflow
======================================================================

1. The Image should be the shape of (batch, height, width, channels)

2. See test.py for the detail of how to use the code

3. It should can be used as RoI Pooling, but I have not compared the performance of this with other implementation of RoI pooling

4. run following for test(need tensorflow and numpy) 
```sh
python test.py
```
